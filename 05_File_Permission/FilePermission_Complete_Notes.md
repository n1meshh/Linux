# File Permissions Management in Linux

## Introduction to File Permissions
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file and directory has three levels of permission:
- **Owner (User)**: The creator of the file.
- **Group**: Users belonging to the assigned group.
- **Others**: All other users on the system.
