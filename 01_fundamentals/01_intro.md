# Linux Fundamentals – Introduction 🐧

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds.  
It is widely used in servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps environments.

Linux = Kernel  
Operating System = Kernel + Tools + Utilities

## Why Linux is Important for DevOps?
DevOps ko core nai Linux ho because:

- Most production servers run on Linux
- Docker and Kubernetes Linux ma based huncha
- Strong command-line support
- Easy automation using shell scripts
- Secure and stable for long-running services



## Linux vs Windows (DevOps Perspective)

| Feature       | Linux          |     Windows |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Open Source   | Yes            | No          |
| Server Usage  | Very High      | Limited     |
| CLI Power     | Very Strong    | Moderate    |
| Automation    | Easy           | Limited     |
| Cloud Friendly| Yes            | Less        |



## Linux Distributions
Linux different versions lai **distributions (distros)** bhanincha.

Common DevOps distros:
- Ubuntu
- CentOS / Rocky Linux
- Amazon Linux
- Debian

Each distro uses same Linux kernel but different package managers and tools.

## Linux Architecture (High Level)
Linux system mainly yo parts le baneko huncha:

1. Hardware
2. Kernel
3. Shell
4. Applications

- Kernel → hardware sanga communicate garcha
- Shell → user ra kernel bich bridge ho
- Applications → user le use garne tools

---

## Key Characteristics of Linux
- Multi-user
- Multitasking
- Secure (permission-based)
- Stable
- Lightweight

---

## DevOps Use Case
Real-world DevOps ma Linux use huncha for:
- Deploying applications
- Managing servers
- Writing CI/CD scripts
- Monitoring logs
- Running containers

---

## Summary
- Linux is the backbone of DevOps
- CLI knowledge is mandatory
- Understanding Linux fundamentals saves time in production issues
